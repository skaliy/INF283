How to open the Jupyter Notebook:
There are different ways of opening a Jupyter Notebook depending on your operating system
and Python distribution. If have installed anacoda then you first need to lauch Jupyter Notebook App. 

The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu (Windows) or by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows):
jupyter notebook

This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open.
